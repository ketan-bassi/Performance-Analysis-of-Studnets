# Performance-Analysis-of-Studnets

# Motivation:

Earning a good grade is not only a measure of subject matter knowledge or
intelligence. Instead, itâ€™s a composite of knowledge, skills, and personality
traits. For example, a student with a good work ethic and discipline could
help their grades because they turn in homework assignments on time and have
good class attendance. Similarly, a student who is driven would be willing to
do additional research for assignments or to seek out learning resources if they
were struggling. Because grades are a composite measurement of student performance,
they can be a better predictor of success than other narrow measures.
The aim of the project is to analyze the performance of student throughout their
academic life and gauge if and how past performance affects future performance.
